Welcome to the course website for <a href="https://www.mgse.econ.uni-muenchen.de/index.html">MGSE</a> online Guest Course: “Natural Language Processing for Economists”. 

<b>What is this course about?</b>  

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an area of research focused on analyzing human
languages computationally and making computers understand and interact with humans,
in their language(s). NLP is a part of many day to day applications we use, such as search
engines, virtual assistants on your smartphones and various functionalities in your email
provider. Economics too is one of
them. From measuring news sentiment and connecting it to the nation’s economy to
extracting key information from policy documents, there are many uses of NLP in
economics research. 

In this course, we will introduce Natural Language Processing (and Machine Learning)
and explore how it can be used to address research questions in economics that require
analysis of textual data. Before starting with this, we will do a Python crash course in the
first few sessions.
