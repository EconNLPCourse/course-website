You can choose from some of [these papers](https://econnlpcourse.github.io/course-materials/) 

6. ## Student term papers 
Briefly summarize what you learnt about the intersection of NLP and Economics by taking this course, and note down some thoughts on how it is useful for your own research topics. Depending on the time and interest, we can decide whether we want to have a presentation session or just writeup submissions.
