# Topic 4: NLP and Economics, Group Discussions

**Instructions:**
1. Students are grouped into teams of 2-4 people and can choose a paper related to economics research that uses NLP methods. You can choose one of the papers from the readings list in [course materials](https://econnlpcourse.github.io/course-materials/) or pick one on your own.   

2. Teams should present for 10 min, we can have a 5-10 min additional discussion per team.  Slides are optional.  

3. **What to cover:**  
   - What problem relevant to economics is covered in the paper
   - What NLP methods are used?
   - How do they fare? What is your opinion about the paper?
   - What are some good ideas for future if you get a chance to work on this topic?

Meeting on: 26th and 28th October 2020 (Schedule with groups and papers will be put up towards the meeting dates!)

# Review session

Meeting on 30th October 2020

# Term papers

Write a problem statement for a research question in your discipline that you think can benefit from using NLP methods. Give some background about the problem, existing ways of addressing it, and how NLP can help. Write about what NLP approaches you learnt in this class can be useful for this problem. You are free to read any related literature, but I want you to come up with a problem statement of your own. Your writeups can be 2-4 pages long, and contain all the above mentioned information.

There is no meeting afterwards. I will send you feedback by email.
