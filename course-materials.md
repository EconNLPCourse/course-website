## Books
There is no single textbook. Here are a few reference books - my teaching material will be based on these. We will try to rely on publicly accessible resources for as much as possible.

- ["Python for Everybody" by Charles Severance](https://www.py4e.com/html3/) (For Python overview)
- [NLTK book](https://nltk.org/book) (For NLP with Python overview)
- ["Practical Natural Language Processing" by Sowmya Vajjala, Bodhisattwa Majumder, Anuj Gupta and Harshit Surana](https://www.amazon.de/Practical-Natural-Language-Processing-Pragmatic/dp/1492054054/). The book is also available for free on O'Reilly's online learning platform (if your university is subscribed).
- "Speech and Language Processing" by Jurafsky and Martin [2nd Edition](https://github.com/rain1024/slp2-pdf). [3rd Edition](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/)

## Papers for Group Discussions
The following is a list of papers at the intersection of NLP and Economics I compiled from some past readings and exploring google scholar's list of 20 most cited Economics journals. The list is neither complete nor objective and I did not read everything. You are free to choose any other relevant paper for the group discussions. You can find links to these by searching for titles on Google Scholar.
